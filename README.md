# Railway-Safety-Line-Crossing-Project

Enhancing Railway Safety with AI-Powered Real-Time Object Detection

Railway crossings are high-risk zones, demanding intelligent monitoring to prevent accidents. To address this challenge, I developed a real-time railway safety crossing detection system using YOLO12 (n, s, m), YOLO11 (n, s, m), and Roboflow 3.0 object detection models.

Key Features & Technologies Used:

âœ… Device: MacBook Air M3

âœ… Real-Time Object Detection for instant decision-making

âœ… Visualization & Frame Capturing with customized data for improved accuracy

âœ… Key Methods & Techniques:

- Bounding Box Regression for precise object localization

- Multi-Class Object Classification to identify diverse elements

- Frame Sampling & Annotation to enhance model training

- Post-Processing Techniques for better detection refinement


This system accurately detects and monitors:

ðŸš¦ Boom Gate Position (Up/Down)

ðŸš— Cars, Trucks, Vans, Motorcycles, Cycles

ðŸš¶ Persons & Traffic Police

ðŸš† Trains and Other Objects

Leveraging AI and deep learning, this project improves railway safety by enabling real-time decision-making at crossings. Excited about future advancements in AI-driven transportation safety!
